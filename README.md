# Jupyter Theme Chesterish Paranoid

[Chesterish theme](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes/blob/master/jupyterthemes/styles/chesterish.less) for Jupyter Notebook is beautiful. However when you need some large font, everything start to fail apart.

So here is a modified Chesterish theme featuring:

* Dark theme
* Large font (16pt) to make your eye happier
* Everything perfectly aligned
* Use your OS native UI font as Jupyter UI font
* Use [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) webfont as monospace font
  * Constant result across devices
  * Acceptable rendering on Windows
  * If you installed [Sarasa Gothic](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic) on your computer, it will be used
